## 2. Themes

[LauzHack](https://lauzhack.com/) is hosting a mini-hackathon with two exciting tracks:

1. **GenAI Applications:**
  - The use of GenAI APIs and models (OpenAI, Langchain, HuggingFace, etc).
  - The Telegram bot builder API can be optionally used for a quick-and-dirty user interface.
  - Build innovative products like an interactive academic publication bot or combine APIs for new applications!

2. **LLM Architecture Modifications:**
  - Identify practical tricks to enhance efficiency and accuracy of LLMs (Large Language Models) on a given dataset.
 
## 3. Resources

1. **GenAI Applications:**
- [Tutorial](https://github.com/LauzHack/apis-telegram) on making a Telegram bot with GenAI APIs. **This will be done on Friday!**
- Message `Eric (organizer)` on the LauzHack Discord for an OpenAI key!

2. **LLM Architecture Modifications:**
- [LLM baselines](https://github.com/epfml/llm-baselines) which **will be presented on Friday**. 
- Access to compute from Prof. Martin Jaggi's lab provided on-site.

Below are links to complementary resources/tutorials which will NOT be covered during the hackathon:
- [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) for hosting a demo.
- RAG with LangChain slides/Colab notebooks ([Part 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nR8klAPeRB6LRJPLk2XQZ951cg7wYuh0uWxgpPg_J7U/edit#slide=id.g2adef65e407_0_396), [Part 2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ud51c1bGjXJGXAmOypQCKdZtu_aAoeHdYYGiaESPfdA/edit#slide=id.g2adef65e407_0_396)).
- (Login required) Short course on using Hugging Face models and Gradio: https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/open-source-models-hugging-face/
- (Login required) More short courses from DeepLearning.ai (LangChain, RAG, Vector Databases, etc): https://learn.deeplearning.ai/
- Google Colab for GPU compute: https://colab.research.google.com/

## 4. Schedule

üòã We will provide dinner on Friday and (breakfast, lunch) on Saturday.

## 5. Team Formation

Up to 4 members per team. Declare your team [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-kltAtBRmXvM_HjfXcLKk_qDzaVmV03A6PDqzfMWOaM/edit?usp=sharing).

## 6. Submission Process

All projects should be submitted on DevPost (coming soon).

In order to be considered for a prize, **all projects should demo/present (3 minutes) on Saturday afternoon**.

#### _Particularies for the LLM Architecture Modifications track_

Submissions to be made to Prof. Martin Jaggi's lab. Due to potentially long trainings, submission can be made until **Sunday April 21, 23:59:59**. Teams are still expected to demo/present on Saturday afternoon, but winners for this track will be announced on **Tuesday April 23**.
