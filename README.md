## 2. Themes

[LauzHack](https://lauzhack.com/) is hosting a mini-hackathon with two exciting tracks:

1. **GenAI Applications:**
  - The use of GenAI APIs and models (OpenAI, Langchain, HuggingFace, etc).
  - The Telegram bot builder API can be optionally used for a quick-and-dirty user interface.
  - Build innovative products like an interactive academic publication bot or combine APIs for new applications!

2. **LLM Architecture Modifications:**
  - Identify practical tricks to enhance efficiency and accuracy of LLMs (Large Language Models) on a given dataset.
 
## 3. Resources

1. **GenAI Applications:**
- [Tutorial](https://github.com/LauzHack/apis-telegram) on making a Telegram bot with GenAI APIs. **This will be done on Friday!**
- Message `Eric (organizer)` on the LauzHack Discord for an OpenAI key!

2. **LLM Architecture Modifications:**
- [LLM baselines](https://github.com/epfml/llm-baselines) which **will be presented on Friday**. 
- Getting started with EPFL clusters: https://github.com/epfml/getting-started-lauzhack/
- Access to compute from Prof. Martin Jaggi's lab provided on-site.

Below are links to complementary resources/tutorials which will NOT be covered during the hackathon:
- [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) for hosting a demo.
- Example interactive web app with HTML and OpenAI: https://github.com/bitswired/python-web-dev-with-htmx 
- Serverless endpoints with [together.ai](https://docs.together.ai/docs/inference-python)

## 5. Team Formation

Up to 4 members per team. Declare your team [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-kltAtBRmXvM_HjfXcLKk_qDzaVmV03A6PDqzfMWOaM/edit?usp=sharing).

## 6. Submission Process

All projects should be submitted on DevPost (coming soon).

In order to be considered for a prize, **all projects should demo/present (3 min for API track, and 2 min for LLM track) on Saturday afternoon**.

#### _Particularies for the LLM Architecture Modifications track_

Due to potentially long trainings, submission can be made until **Sunday April 21, 23:59:59**. Teams are still expected to demo/present on Saturday afternoon, but winners for this track will be announced on **Tuesday April 23**.
Resources: 1) [Getting started guide for GPU cluster](https://github.com/epfml/getting-started-lauzhack), 2) [llm-baselines code](https://github.com/epfml/llm-baselines) to start from. Submission consist in a link to your github repo (see criteria below), to be made to Prof. Martin Jaggi's lab via discord. 

## 7. Communication (Discord)

Real-time information about the event, food service details, and questions related to the challenges will be posted in our personal Discord server (`#hack-apr2024` channel). Please use the link sent to you via Luma (as this will add you to the private channel for the event).

## 8. Evaluation Criteria
