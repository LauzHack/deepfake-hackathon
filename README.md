## 1. General Information

### **Date & Time:**

- **Date:** Friday, September 13 to Saturday, September 14
- **Time:** 6:00 PM (Sep 13) to 5:00 PM (Sep 14)

### **Location:**

[EPFL AI Center Lounge](https://plan.epfl.ch/?room==ELE%20117)

## 2. Themes

[LauzHack](https://lauzhack.com/) is hosting a mini-hackathon with two exciting tracks:

TODO

1. **Generation (red team):**

- The use of GenAI APIs and models (OpenAI, Langchain, HuggingFace, etc).
- The [Telegram bot builder API](https://github.com/LauzHack/apis-telegram) can be optionally used for a quick-and-dirty user interface, or a web app ([example1](https://www.gradio.app/), [example2](https://github.com/bitswired/python-web-dev-with-htmx)).
- Build innovative products by combining APIs for new applications!

2. **Detection (blue team):**

- Identify practical tricks to enhance efficiency and accuracy of LLMs (Large Language Models) on a given dataset.

## 3. Resources

1. **Generation (red team):**

TODO

- [Tutorial](https://github.com/LauzHack/apis-telegram) on making a Telegram bot with GenAI APIs. **This will be done on Friday!**
- Message `Eric (organizer)` on the LauzHack Discord for an OpenAI key!

2. **Detection (blue team):**

- [Tutorial for setup](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1soBPwgoU0SkEhKjNMcZH2vwbuAWAGt2rLuADtnFlZwg/edit#slide=id.g2cd7ccab6c0_0_0).
- [LLM baselines](https://github.com/epfml/llm-baselines) which **will be presented on Friday**.
- Getting started with EPFL clusters: https://github.com/epfml/getting-started-lauzhack/
