## 7. Communication (Discord)

Real-time information about the event, food service details, and questions related to the challenges will be posted in our personal Discord server (`#deepfake-sep2024` channel). Please use the link sent to you via Luma (as this will add you to the private channel for the event).

## 8. Guidelines

General Guidelines are provided by Lauzhack, though if you choose to be part of a red team, the following additional guidelines apply.

In addition, deep fakes are a sensitive topic, and this hackathon explores both blue team (defensive) and red team (offensive) approaches. For red teams, special rules apply, see below. **However, the following rule applies to everyone in attendance: Consider this a private event \- do not record any deep fakes that are being created during the hackathon (if you have a particular reason why you‚Äôd want to do that, speak to the organizers first).**

### Generation track (Red Team) Rules

If you are participating in a red team, please consider the following rules. Our goal is not to limit your creativity - on the contrary, we encourage you to push the boundaries and show us what‚Äôs possible! However, it‚Äôs important that your well-intended work doesn‚Äôt inadvertently cause harm.

- As a principle, do not create deep fakes of real people.
- For public figures (famous people for which there is a lot of content online), you are allowed to create deep fakes _in the confinement of this event_ - but see rules below.
- Every deep fake you create must be very clearly labeled as such
- Refrain from producing deeply offensive content.
- No sharing or publishing of generated content or code outside the event without review
- If in doubt: please regularly check-in with organizers to ensure adherence to guidelines

## 9. Evaluation Criteria

Only work done during hackathon will be considered (and should be made explicit) for the project evaluation.
