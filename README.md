## 7. Communication

Real-time information about the event, food service details, and questions related to the challenges will be posted in our personal Discord server (`#deepfake-sep2024` channel). Please use the link sent to you via Luma (to get access to the private channel for this event).

## 8. Guidelines

General Guidelines are provided by the [LauzHack rules](https://lauzhack.com/pdf/rules.pdf), though if you choose to be part of a red team, the following additional guidelines apply.

As deep fakes are a sensitive topic, and this hackathon explores both blue team (defensive) and red team (offensive) approaches, special rules apply. **The following rule applies to everyone in attendance: Consider this a private event. Do not record any deep fakes created during the hackathon. If you have any question regarding this rule, ask the organizers first. This is very important as you might be liable for any harm caused by your actions.**

The following additional rules apply to the Red team:

### Generation track (Red Team) Rules

Our goal is not to limit your creativity - on the contrary, we encourage you to push the boundaries and show us what‚Äôs possible! However, it‚Äôs important that your well-intioned work does not inadvertently cause harm.

- As a principle, do not create deep fakes of real people
- For public figures (famous people for which there is a lot of content online), you are allowed to create deep fakes _in the scope of this event_ - see additional rules below
- Every deep fake you create must be very clearly labeled as such
- Refrain from producing deeply offensive content
- No sharing or publishing of generated content or code outside the event without review
- If in doubt: please regularly check-in with organizers to ensure adherence to guidelines

## 9. Evaluation Criteria

Only work done during hackathon will be considered (and should be made explicit) for the project evaluation.
